## Overview

#### Business Need

EthioMart envisions becoming the leading platform for all e-commerce activities conducted via Telegram in Ethiopia. As Telegram gains popularity for business transactions, many independent e-commerce channels have emerged, each managing its own operations. This fragmentation creates difficulties for both vendors and customers, who must juggle multiple channels for product discovery, order placement, and communication.

To address this issue, EthioMart plans to develop a centralized platform that aggregates real-time data from various Telegram e-commerce channels into one unified space. This will streamline the customer experience, allowing seamless exploration and interaction with multiple vendors in a single location.

This project is dedicated to refining a large language model (LLM) for Amharic Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract key business entities, such as product names, prices, and locations, from text, images, and documents shared across Telegram channels. The extracted information will populate EthioMart's centralized database, making it a comprehensive hub for e-commerce in Ethiopia.

#### Key Objectives:

- Real-time data extraction from Telegram channels

- Fine-tuning LLM to extract entities like product names, prices, 
and locations
